# Pivotal Cloud Cache Node.js API Examples
 
The examples in this repository show how to use the [Pivotal Cloud Cache Node.js Client API](https://github.com/gemfire/gemfire-node-client) to build Cloud Cache client applications.

Each example is contained in its own subdirectory, with an explanatory README file.

All of the examples show how to build and run a NodeJS app using a local GemFire cluster. Two of the examples (`book-service` and `nextjs-page-counter`) also illustrate how to build and run a NodeJS app using a Cloud Cache instance.

For further information, see the [Pivotal Cloud Cache Node.js Client User Guide](http://gemfire-nodeclient.docs.pivotal.io/2-0/about-client-users-guide.html).
